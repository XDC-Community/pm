# Ethereum Project Management Repository

This repository is used for project management for various initiatives affecting the XDC Network. The main use of this repository is for the All Core Devs meeting.

## All Core Devs Meetings

### Purpose

The All Core Devs meeting is a technical call intended to bring together various XDC Network teams who play major roles in determining the direction of the protocol. XDC Network client and research teams provide updates on their projects, discuss various [XIPs](https://xips.xdc.community/) to improve the protocol, and support each other as we **build** Web 3.0.

### Agendas

The agendas for the calls are tracked in the Issues tab of this repository, under the "agenda" label ([link](https://github.com/XDC-Community/pm/labels/agenda)). To add an item to an agenda, please [open an issue in this repository](https://github.com/XDC-Community/pm/issues/new) which mentions the topic you want to discuss and links any relevant materials (XIPs, prototypes, etc.). Then, leave a comment in the agenda where you would like this to be discussed.

Anyone is welcome to add an item to the agenda as long as it follows these guidelines:

- The topic is technical in nature.
- The topic involves the XDC Network protocol at a low-level. This means Dapps and XRCs are generally not allowed as topics.
- The topic should not be philosophical. The core developer meetings are not meant to decide philosophical contentious issues that should be decided by the community. There are exceptions to this, but generally these topics distract from more productive technical discussion.

### Who Can Attend

Protocol developers, client developers, and core XDC Network researchers are invited to attend the meetings. Generally every XDC Network client is represented as well as key members of Layer 1 research/scaling teams. Sometimes a non-core developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. If you feel you would contribute to the meetings by your attendance please reach out to [Jon McBee](mailto:jon@xdc.org).

### Who Manages the Meetings

The meetings are independent of any organization. However, Jon McBee is a member of the XDC Foundation and the XDC Foundation pays for the videoconference software used in the meetings.
